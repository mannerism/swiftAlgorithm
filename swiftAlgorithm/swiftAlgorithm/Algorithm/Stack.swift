	public var isEmpty: Bool {
		return array.isEmpty
	}

		return array.count

		array.append(element)
	}

}

//Notice that a push puts the new element at the end of the array, not the beginning.

//Inserting at the beginning of an array is expensive, an O(n) operation, because it requires all existing array elements to be shifted in memory.

//Adding at the end is O(1); it always takes the same amount of time, regardless of the size of the array.

//Fun fact about stacks: Each time you call a function or a method, the CPU places the return address on a stack. When the function ends, the CPU uses that return address to jump back to the caller. That's why if you call too many functions -- for example in a recursive function that never ends -- you get a so-called "stack overflow" as the CPU stack has run out of space.
